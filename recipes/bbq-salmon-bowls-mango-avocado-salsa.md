## Ingredients

### Salmon
- 1–2 lbs. fresh salmon
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### Mango Avocado Salsa

- 1/4 cup minced cilantro
- 1/4 cup minced red onion
- 1/2 jalapeño, minced (optional)
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 2 tablespoons lime juice + 1 teaspoon lime zest
- Salt to taste

### For Serving
- 1 1/2 cups rice

## Instructions

1. **Prepare salsa:** Combine all salsa ingredients; taste and adjust seasonings.

2. **Cook rice:** Prepare according to package directions.

3. **Preheat oven:** Set to 475°F or 500°F broil setting with rack positioned about 6 inches from top.

4. **Prepare salmon:** Mix spices with olive oil to create a paste. Place salmon skin-side down on foil-lined baking sheet. Apply paste generously. Bake 6-12 minutes depending on thickness and doneness preference.

5. **Assemble bowls:** Layer rice, salmon portions, and mango avocado salsa.

## Notes

- Salmon is done when it transitions from translucent to opaque and begins flaking
- Smaller filets (1-1.5 lbs) minimize leftovers
- Fresh mangoes are preferred; frozen chunks work if thawed
- Optional vegetables can enhance bowls (mushrooms, asparagus suggested)
